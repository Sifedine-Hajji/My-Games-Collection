## How I Proceeded ?

I used Bootstrap to get a visual at the cards that i would make and then i copied the html in to javascript. for the javascript i had to follow the following steps in the repository: [bxl-hopper-1-25](https://github.com/becodeorg/bxl-hopper-1-25/tree/master/The%20Field/5.leaving_the_field) to generate the rest of the javascript functionnalities as the searchBar.

## Framework
* Bootstrap was used for this project.
